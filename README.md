### Hi there 👋
✨You found a secret page of a Python software engineer.✨

Here is my online pet Django projects, you can try to visit them (if they are up 😄):
* 🔭 [Character creation project](https://windowhero.herokuapp.com/) with stats and leveling up ([Source code](https://github.com/IharSha/build_a_hero)).
* 💬 [Blog example](https://rutasblog.herokuapp.com/). (Although, never have time to blog 🤔).

Here is a small console game written on Python where you have to find treasure (or die):
* 👾 Why so serious ([Source Code](https://github.com/IharSha/why_so_serious))

A cross-platform app for creating multiple stopwatches and saving them for whatever task you do.<br> For example, you can measure how long it takes what you do on a daily basis (watching movies, working, playing)<br>
Written in Python with the help of Kivy package for GUI:
* ⏱️ Time Yourself ([Source Code](https://github.com/IharSha/timeyourself))

Also, I enjoy problem solving:

* Some of the [solutions](https://github.com/IharSha/my_projecteuler) for the projecteuler.net.
* And [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/Rutik) is my profile with achievements and badges on the HackerRank.
