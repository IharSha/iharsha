<br>

A cross-platform app for creating multiple stopwatches and saving them for whatever task you do.<br> For example, you can measure how long it takes what you do on a daily basis (watching movies, working, playing)<br>
Written in Python with the help of Kivy package for GUI:
* ⏱️ Time Yourself ([Source Code](https://github.com/IharSha/timeyourself))
